- [x] M0 Scaffold — 2026-10-04
- [ ] M1 … [ ] M10 not started

## M0 Scaffold (2026-10-04)
Done:
- Old untracked implementation (app/, scripts/, tests/, pyproject/uv.lock, old docs, copilot-instructions, old CI) moved to legacy/ (git-ignored, reference only).
- data/raw → data/raw_pdfs (10 PDFs present). backend/app/{config,models}.py; Protocol + Fake for Embedder, CrossEncoderLike, LLMClient, Translator.
- backend/requirements.txt, pytest.ini (pythonpath=.), scripts/ci.sh, .github/workflows/ci.yml. 18 tests green, no models/Ollama needed.
Decisions:
- Settings via pydantic-settings, env prefix HAKI_; ACTS tuple in config.py with ActSpec(name, year, file, url, unit).
- Dropped pytest-asyncio: 0.23.3 crashes collection under pytest 9.1 (FastAPI TestClient is sync, so not needed).
- python-docx and sacremoses not pinned yet: install hung (bandwidth shared with the Ollama pull); pin them in M7 / M6 when first used.
- Old frontend/ scaffold left untracked; M8 replaces it.
Open issues:
- Act years in config.py are from general knowledge (Employment 2007, L&T Shops 1965, Rent Restriction 1959, CPC 1930, Traffic 1953, Legal Aid 2016, ...): confirm against PDF cover pages in M1.
- README.md and LICENSE have uncommitted edits from before M0 (not touched; README still describes the old setup → rewrite in M10).
Next: M1 Ingestion.
